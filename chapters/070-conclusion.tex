\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}
As this exploration of MTMCT concludes, it is clear that the field continues to navigate complex challenges and evolving requirements. By exploring different methodologies, their inherent limitations, and possible future directions, insight is provided into the current state and potential evolution of MTMCT, particularly in the context of online and real-time environments.

While frameworks such as R-CNN, YOLO, SORT, and DeepSORT have advanced intra-camera tracking, their limitations in inter-camera environments underscore the specific challenges of MTMCT. These challenges include the need for effective inter-camera tracking, robust data association across multiple camera views, and maintaining consistent tracking accuracy in diverse and dynamic environments.

The integration of MTMCT with emerging technologies such as edge computing and IoT presents exciting opportunities to improve the scope and effectiveness of tracking systems. These integrations could lead to more comprehensive and versatile systems capable of meeting real-time tracking requirements in applications ranging from urban surveillance to traffic management and public safety.

However, the advancement of MTMCT technologies also brings to the forefront the need for careful consideration of ethical and privacy issues. As the capabilities of MTMCT systems expand, it is important to ensure their responsible use and address the societal implications of widespread surveillance. This includes developing frameworks that respect individual privacy and address the broader societal implications of these technologies.

In conclusion, MTMCT is an area of significant potential and will, as it already does, impact a wide range of sectors. The way forward requires not only technological innovation, but also a collaborative approach involving researchers, technologists, policy makers and ethicists. By addressing current limitations and exploring new horizons, MTMCT can achieve new levels of efficiency and accuracy, ushering in a new era of sophisticated and responsible real-time tracking systems.
